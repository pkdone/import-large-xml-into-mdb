Masters
- Masters: Master Release is a display function that gathers two or more matching releases together. It can be thought of as a folder that holds two or more Discogs releases.
 - An example would be gathering several versions of an album, such as Michael Jackson - Off The Wall.
- Master Release does not change the data of the contained releases. https://support.discogs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005055493-Database-Guidelines-16-Master-Release
- Masters: Look like a page for a normal release, except the bottom of the page then has a list of versions (releases), e.g.: https://www.discogs.com/The-God-Machine-Scenes-From-The-Second-Storey/master/22316
